## Live Instances

## Ranking behavior

- When you are logged in, profile lookups and author resolution use **personalizedPagerank** from your point of view (your pubkey is sent as `source`).
- When you are not logged in, the app falls back to **globalPagerank**.

This applies when resolving usernames like `by:john` or direct profile lookups like `p:john`. See the Vertex docs for details on parameters and response format: [`https://vertexlab.io/docs/services/search-profiles/`](https://vertexlab.io/docs/services/search-profiles/).

Note that proper username resolution requires Vertex credits. See [Vertex pricing](https://vertexlab.io/pricing/) for details on credit costs and tiers.

### Vertex credit fallback

If the Vertex DVM responds with an "insufficient credits" status, we fall back to a relay search for `kind:0` profiles matching the username and rank candidates as follows:

- Logged in: prioritize profiles that you directly follow; tiebreak by prefix match and name.
- Not logged in: sort by the number of follower references (count of `kind:3` contacts that include the candidate pubkey), then prefix match and name.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### Configuration

Set the public site URL (used for Open Graph/Twitter metadata) via environment variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://search.dergigi.com
```

You can place this in a local `.env` file.

### Search substitutions

All search substitutions (site aliases, media type expansions, etc.) are loaded from [`replacements.txt`](public/replacements.txt). This file contains the mappings for `site:`, `is:`, and `has:` modifiers, making it easy to see what substitutions are currently available and add new ones.
