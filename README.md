### Profile Lookup
- `p:fiatjaf` - Look up a profile

## Features

- Search for nostr posts (kind 1)
- Profile lookups via vertex.im (e.g. `p:fiatjaf`)
- Random search examples for inspiration
- Clean, minimal interface
- Fast search results

## Ranking behavior

- When you are logged in, profile lookups and author resolution use **personalizedPagerank** from your point of view (your pubkey is sent as `source`).
- When you are not logged in, the app falls back to **globalPagerank**.

This applies when resolving usernames like `by:john` or direct profile lookups like `p:john`. See the Vertex docs for details on parameters and response format: [`https://vertexlab.io/docs/services/search-profiles/`](https://vertexlab.io/docs/services/search-profiles/).

### Vertex credit fallback

If the Vertex DVM responds with an "insufficient credits" status, we fall back to a relay search for `kind:0` profiles matching the username and rank candidates as follows:

- Logged in: prioritize profiles that you directly follow; tiebreak by prefix match and name.
- Not logged in: sort by the number of follower references (count of `kind:3` contacts that include the candidate pubkey), then prefix match and name.
