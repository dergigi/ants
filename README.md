## URL Paths

The application supports several direct URL paths for quick access:

### Profile Pages

- `/p/[id]` - View a specific profile and their latest notes
  - `/p/npub1...` - Direct profile by npub
  - `/p/@username.com` - Profile by NIP-05 identifier
  - `/p/username` - Profile search by username

### Event Pages

- `/e/[id]` - View a specific event
  - `/e/nevent1...` - Event by nevent identifier
  - `/e/note1...` - Event by note identifier
  - `/e/[hex-id]` - Event by 64-character hex ID

### Hashtag Pages

- `/t/[hashtags]` - Search multiple hashtags
  - `/t/pugstr` - Search for #pugstr
  - `/t/pugstr,dogstr,goatstr` - Search for #pugstr OR #dogstr OR #goatstr
  - `/t/pugstr+dogstr+goatstr` - Alternative syntax for multiple hashtags
  - `/t/pugstr dogstr goatstr` - Space-separated hashtags

## Features

- Search for nostr posts (kind 1)
- Profile lookups via vertex.im (e.g. `p:fiatjaf`)
- Full-text profile search across names and bios
- Profile pages with latest notes (`/p/npub1...`)
- Random search examples for inspiration
- Clean, minimal interface
- Fast search results
- NIP-50 search extensions support
- Site-specific search with aliases
- Media type filtering (images, videos, gifs)
- Boolean OR operator support
- URL and bech32 identifier resolution

## Relay logic

- Hardcoded relay sets for default use and NIP-50 search are augmented on login via NIP-51:
  - kind:10002 user relays (general connections)
  - kind:10006 blocked relays (excluded)
  - kind:10007 search relays (added to search set)
- Relay capabilities are read via NIP-11 (`supported_nips`) and shown in the relay status indicator.
- The relay status indicator highlights relays that returned current results (shown in blue), marks NIP-50 relays with a magnifying glass, and lets you filter results by relay.

## Search logic

Two query types:

- Search queries (NIP-50):
  - Connect only to NIP-50-capable relays
  - Run one search per OR-clause/expanded query
- Direct queries (NIP-19 bech32: `npub`, `note`, `nprofile`, `nevent`, `naddr`):
  - Connect to the broader relay set
  - Fetch the entity directly (no NIP-50 required)

Examples:

- `is:highlight by:fiatjaf OR #YESTR by:dergigi.com` â†’ resolves to two direct filters: `kind:9802 by:<npub(hex)>` and `t:yestr by:<npub(hex)>` (no full-text search).
- `has:video by:HODL` â†’ `has:video` expands to file extensions, requiring NIP-50 full-text search.

## Profile lookups and Vertex

- `by:` and `p:` try best-effort profile resolution.
- Logged in: use Vertex DVM with `personalizedPagerank`. Logged out/unavailable: NIP-50 fallback with heuristic ranking.
- Results are cached by search string and login state.
- NIP-05 identifiers are resolved directly to hex without hitting search relays when valid. Plaintext usernames (e.g., `fiatjaf`) are queried via NIP-50 (`kind:0 <term>`).

## Live Instances

- [search.dergigi.com](https://search.dergigi.com/)

## Ranking behavior

- When logged in and Vertex credits are available, profile lookups and author resolution use **personalizedPagerank** (your pubkey is sent as `source`).
- When logged out or Vertex is unavailable, relay-based ranking is used (see fallback below).

This applies when resolving usernames like `by:john` or direct profile lookups like `p:john`. See the Vertex docs for details on parameters and response format: [`https://vertexlab.io/docs/services/search-profiles/`](https://vertexlab.io/docs/services/search-profiles/).

Note that proper username resolution requires Vertex credits. See [Vertex pricing](https://vertexlab.io/pricing/) for details on credit costs and tiers.

### Fallback ranking

If Vertex is unavailable or credits are insufficient (or when logged out), we fall back to a relay search for `kind:0` profiles matching the username and rank candidates as follows:

- Logged in: prioritize profiles that you directly follow; tiebreak by prefix match and name.
- Not logged in: sort by the number of follower references (count of `kind:3` contacts that include the candidate pubkey), then prefix match and name.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### Configuration

Set the public site URL (used for Open Graph/Twitter metadata) via environment variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://search.dergigi.com
```

You can place this in a local `.env` file.

### Search substitutions

All search substitutions (site aliases, media type expansions, etc.) are loaded from [`replacements.txt`](public/replacements.txt). This file contains the mappings for `site:`, `is:`, and `has:` modifiers, making it easy to see what substitutions are currently available and add new ones.
