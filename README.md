## Ranking behavior

- When you are logged in, profile lookups and author resolution use **personalizedPagerank** from your point of view (your pubkey is sent as `source`).
- When you are not logged in, the app falls back to **globalPagerank**.

This applies when resolving usernames like `by:john` or direct profile lookups like `p:john`. See the Vertex docs for details on parameters and response format: [`https://vertexlab.io/docs/services/search-profiles/`](https://vertexlab.io/docs/services/search-profiles/).

### Vertex credit fallback

If the Vertex DVM responds with an "insufficient credits" status, we fall back to a relay search for `kind:0` profiles matching the username and rank candidates as follows:

- Logged in: prioritize profiles that you directly follow; tiebreak by prefix match and name.
- Not logged in: sort by the number of follower references (count of `kind:3` contacts that include the candidate pubkey), then prefix match and name.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Search substitutions

All search substitutions (site aliases, media type expansions, etc.) are loaded from [`replacements.txt`](public/replacements.txt). This file contains the mappings for `site:`, `is:`, and `has:` modifiers, making it easy to see what substitutions are currently available and add new ones.
